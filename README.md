## üìä Project Overview

- **Objective:** Predict the sale prices of houses using a dataset with features like location, size, number of bedrooms, and other characteristics.  
- **Dataset:** The data is sourced from **Kaggle**.  
- **Tech Stack:** Python, Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Seaborn, Scikit-Learn, XGBoost.  
- **Models Used:** Linear Regression, Decision Trees, Random Forest, and XGBoost.

## üìÅ Dataset Description

The dataset contains the following key attributes:

- **Id:** Unique identifier for each property  
- **OverallQual:** Overall material and finish quality  
- **YearBuilt:** Year the house was built  
- **TotalBsmtSF:** Total square footage of the basement  
- **GrLivArea:** Above ground living area in square feet  
- **FullBath:** Number of full bathrooms  
- **GarageCars:** Number of cars in the garage  
- **SalePrice:** Sale price of the house (Target Variable)

## üöÄ Project Workflow

1. **Data Preprocessing:**  
    - Handle missing values  
    - Perform exploratory data analysis (EDA)  
    - Feature engineering and selection  

2. **Model Building:**  
    - Train and evaluate models using various regression algorithms  
    - Tune hyperparameters for optimal results  

3. **Evaluation Metrics:**  
    - Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE)  
    - Mean Absolute Error (MAE)  
    - R-Squared Score
